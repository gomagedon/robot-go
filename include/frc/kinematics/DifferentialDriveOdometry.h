 * Class for differential drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the

 * 2 encoders and a gyroscope.
 *
 * Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like
 * path following. Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation
 * when using computer-vision systems.
 *
 * Note: It is important to reset both your encoders to zero before you start
 * using this class. Only reset your encoders ONCE. You should not reset your
 * encoders even if you want to reset your robot's pose.
